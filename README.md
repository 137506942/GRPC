gRPC Unity Package


## What is it?

Just a bunch of scripts and a travis config to build a nice package to support gRPC in Unity Engine.

It aims to be as vanilla as possible.

Check out the [releases](https://github.com/jsmouret/grpc-unity-package/releases) to download the latest version.
Just unzip it in your Assets folder.

## What's supported?

gRPC 1.13.0

* Windows / Linux / OSX are extracted straight from the official Nuget package
* Android is build with Travis
* iOS TBD

## Help wanted!

Tests and feedbacks are welcomed. Let's make Unity and gRPC work smoothly together.
